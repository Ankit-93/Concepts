    <h1>Statistics Interview Questions</h1>

    <div class="question">1. What is the Central Limit Theorem and why is it important?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that the distribution of the sum (or average) of a large number of 
        independent, identically distributed random variables approaches a normal (or Gaussian) distribution, 
        regardless of the original distribution of the variables. This is crucial in statistics because it allows us to 
        make inferences about populations using the normal distribution, which has well-understood properties.
    </div>

    <div class="question">2. Explain Type I and Type II errors.</div>
    <div class="answer">
        <strong>Type I Error (False Positive, or Alpha error):</strong> Occurs when you incorrectly reject a true null hypothesis.<br>
        <strong>Type II Error (False Negative, or Beta error):</strong> Occurs when you fail to reject a false null hypothesis.<br>
        The significance level (usually denoted by α) is the probability of making a Type I error. The power of a test is 
        1 minus the probability of making a Type II error (β).
    </div>

    <div class="question">3. What is R-squared in linear regression?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        R-squared, also known as the coefficient of determination, measures the proportion of the variance in the 
        dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variables in a regression model. An R-squared value 
        of 1 indicates that the regression predictions perfectly fit the data, whereas values close to 0 indicate that 
        the model does not explain much of the variance.
    </div>

    <div class="question">4. What is the difference between correlation and causation?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        Correlation indicates a mutual relationship or association between two variables. When one variable changes, 
        there's a tendency for the other variable to change in a specific direction. However, correlation does not 
        imply causation. Causation means that a change in one variable is responsible for a change in another. For 
        example, a strong correlation between ice cream sales and drowning incidents does not mean ice cream causes 
        drowning—both are likely influenced by temperature.
    </div>

    <div class="question">5. What is the difference between a parametric and a non-parametric test?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        <strong>Parametric tests:</strong> Assume the population follows a certain distribution (e.g., normal). Examples include t-tests and ANOVA.<br>
        <strong>Non-parametric tests:</strong> Do not make strong assumptions about the population distribution. Examples include the Mann-Whitney U test 
        and Kruskal-Wallis test.
    </div>

    <div class="question">6. Explain p-value.</div>
    <div class="answer">
        The p-value helps determine the significance of results in hypothesis testing. It represents the probability of 
        observing the current data, or something more extreme, given that the null hypothesis is true. A small p-value 
        (typically ≤ 0.05) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, leading us to reject it.
    </div>

    <div class="question">7. Describe the difference between cross-validation and bootstrapping.</div>
    <div class="answer">
        <strong>Cross-validation:</strong> A technique for evaluating the performance of a statistical model by partitioning the data into a training set 
        and a test set. A common method is k-fold cross-validation.<br>
        <strong>Bootstrapping:</strong> A resampling technique used to estimate the distribution of a statistic by sampling with replacement from the data. 
        It helps assess the variability of a sample statistic and construct confidence intervals.
