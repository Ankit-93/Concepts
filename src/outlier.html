    <h1>Removing Outliers from a Dataset</h1>
    <p><i>Outliers are values that lie significantly outside the normal range of a dataset. Removing outliers is an important step in data cleaning, as they can distort the analysis. One common method of identifying outliers is by using the **Interquartile Range (IQR)**.</i></p>
    
    <h2>Dataset Example</h2>
    <pre>
        Original Dataset: [3, 7, 8, 5, 12, 19, 15, 10, 4, 6]
    </pre>

    <h3>Step 1: Calculate the Five-Number Summary</h3>
    <pre>
        Ordered Dataset: [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 15, 19]

        Minimum = 3
        Q1 (25th percentile) = 4.5 (between 4 and 5)
        Median (Q2) = 7.5 (between 7 and 8)
        Q3 (75th percentile) = 11.5 (between 10 and 12)
        Maximum = 19
    </pre>

    <h3>Step 2: Calculate the Interquartile Range (IQR)</h3>
    <pre>
        IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 11.5 - 4.5 = 7
    </pre>

    <h3>Step 3: Determine the Lower and Upper Boundaries for Outliers</h3>
    <pre>
        Lower Bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR = 4.5 - 1.5 * 7 = 4.5 - 10.5 = -6
        Upper Bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR = 11.5 + 1.5 * 7 = 11.5 + 10.5 = 22
    </pre>

    <h3>Step 4: Identify and Remove Outliers</h3>
    <pre>
        Any data point less than -6 or greater than 22 is considered an outlier.
        In this dataset:
        - No value is less than -6.
        - The maximum value is 19, which is within the range of -6 to 22.
        
        Therefore, there are no outliers to remove in this case.
    </pre>

    <h3>Step 5: (Hypothetical) If There Were Outliers</h3>
    <p>If there were outliers beyond the calculated boundaries, you could remove them. For example, if the dataset had a value like 25, it would be considered an outlier and would be removed.</p>
    <pre>
        After removing outliers (if any), the updated dataset would look like:
        [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 15]
    </pre>
