    <h2 class="section-header">One-Tailed & Two-Tailed Hypothesis Test</h2>

    <div>
        <h3 class="section-header">Problem Statement</h3>
        <pre>
Colleges in Karnataka have an average placement rate of **85%**.
A new college has a sample of **150 students** with a placement rate of **88%** and a standard deviation of **4%**.

Does this college have a different placement rate? We will conduct both **One-Tailed and Two-Tailed Tests**.
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3 class="section-header">Step 1: Define Hypotheses</h3>
        <pre>
🔹 **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: The new college has the same placement rate as other Karnataka colleges.
   - H₀: p = 0.85

🔹 **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁) - Two-Tailed Test**: The new college has a different placement rate.
   - H₁: p ≠ 0.85 (We check if placement rate is significantly different in either direction)

🔹 **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁) - One-Tailed Test**: The new college has a higher placement rate.
   - H₁: p > 0.85 (We check if placement rate is significantly higher)
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3 class="section-header">Step 2: Calculate Z-Score</h3>
        <pre>
Formula: 
       Z = (p̂ - p) / (σ / √n)

Where:
- p̂ = 0.88 (Sample Placement Rate)
- p  = 0.85 (Population Placement Rate)
- σ  = 0.04 (Standard Deviation)
- n  = 150 (Sample Size)

Plugging in values:
       Z = (0.88 - 0.85) / (0.04 / √150)
       Z = 0.03 / (0.04 / 12.247)
       Z = 0.03 / 0.003267
       Z ≈ 9.18
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3 class="section-header">Step 3: Determine Critical Values</h3>
        <pre>
For a **Two-Tailed Test** at **α = 0.05**:
- Critical Z-values: ±1.96
- Decision Rule: If |Z| > 1.96, we reject H₀.

For a **One-Tailed Test** (Right-Tailed) at **α = 0.05**:
- Critical Z-value: 1.645
- Decision Rule: If Z > 1.645, we reject H₀.
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3 class="section-header">Step 4: Compare & Conclusion</h3>
        <pre>
Our calculated Z-score: **9.18**

🔹 **For the Two-Tailed Test**:
- |9.18| > 1.96 → Reject H₀.
- Conclusion: The new college has a **significantly different** placement rate.

🔹 **For the One-Tailed Test (Right-Tail)**:
- 9.18 > 1.645 → Reject H₀.
- Conclusion: The new college has a **significantly higher** placement rate.

✅ **Final Answer**: The new college has a placement rate that is significantly higher than 85%.

        <h2 class="section-header">Confidence Interval and Point Estimate</h2>
        <h3>Problem Statement:</h3>
        <pre>
          On a quantitative test of the CAT, the standard deviation is known to be 100. A sample of 25 test takers has a mean score of 520. 
          Construct a 95% confidence interval about the population mean.
        </pre>
        <h3>Confidence Interval and Point Estimate</h3>
        <pre>
              Step 1: Identify the given values
              - Sample Mean (X̄): 520
              - Population Standard Deviation (σ): 100
              - Sample Size (n): 25
              - Confidence Level: 95%
          
              Step 2: Find the Z-Score for 95% Confidence Level
              - For a 95% confidence level, the Z-value ≈ 1.96.
          
              Step 3: Calculate the Standard Error (SE)
              SE = σ / √n
              SE = 100 / √25
              SE = 100 / 5
              SE = 20
          
              Step 4: Calculate the Confidence Interval
              CI = X̄ ± Z * SE
              CI = 520 ± 1.96 * 20
              CI = 520 ± 39.2
          
              So, the 95% Confidence Interval is: **(480.8, 559.2)**
          
              Conclusion: We are 95% confident that the true population mean lies between 480.8 and 559.2.

        <h3>One-Sample Z-Test for Medication Effect on Intelligence</h3>
        
        <h4>Problem Statement:</h4>
        <pre>
          In the population, the average IQ is 100 with a standard deviation of 15. Researchers want to test a new medication to see if 
          it has a positive, negative, or no effect on intelligence. A sample of 30 people who have taken the medication has a mean IQ of 140. 
          Does the medication affect intelligence?
        </pre>
      
        <h4>Hypothesis:</h4>
        <pre>
          Null Hypothesis (H₀): μ = 100 (No effect)
          Alternative Hypothesis (Hₐ): μ ≠ 100 (Has an effect)
        </pre>
      
        <h4>Calculations:</h4>
        <pre>
          Given:
          - Sample Mean (X̄) = 140
          - Population Mean (μ) = 100
          - Standard Deviation (σ) = 15
          - Sample Size (n) = 30
      
          Step 1: Compute Standard Error (SE)
          SE = σ / √n
          SE = 15 / √30
          SE = 15 / 5.477
          SE ≈ 2.737
      
          Step 2: Compute Z-Score
          Z = (X̄ - μ) / SE
          Z = (140 - 100) / 2.737
          Z ≈ 14.62
      
          Step 3: Compare with Critical Value
          - Critical Z-Value at 95% Confidence (α = 0.05, two-tailed) = ±1.96
          - Since |14.62| > 1.96, we reject the null hypothesis.
      
          Conclusion:
          - The test is statistically significant.
          - The medication has a significant effect on intelligence.

          Alternative Hypothesis (Hₐ): μ ≠ 100 (Has an effect)
        </pre>
      
        <h4>Calculations:</h4>
        <pre>
          Given:
          - Sample Mean (X̄) = 140
          - Population Mean (μ) = 100
          - Sample Standard Deviation (s) = 15
          - Sample Size (n) = 30
      
          Step 1: Compute Standard Error (SE)
          SE = s / √n
          SE = 15 / √30
          SE = 15 / 5.477
          SE ≈ 2.737
      
          Step 2: Compute t-Score
          t = (X̄ - μ) / SE
          t = (140 - 100) / 2.737
          t ≈ 14.62
      
          Step 3: Determine Degrees of Freedom
          df = n - 1 = 30 - 1 = 29
      
          Step 4: Compare with Critical Value
          - Critical t-Value at 95% Confidence (α = 0.05, two-tailed) = ±2.045
          - Since |14.62| > 2.045, we reject the null hypothesis.
      
          Conclusion:
          - The test is statistically significant.
          - The medication has a significant effect on intelligence.
